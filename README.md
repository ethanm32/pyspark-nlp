# PySpark NLP Project

This project demonstrates how to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) with PySpark. The goal is to showcase PySpark's capabilities in processing large datasets for various NLP tasks, including tokenization, text classification, and sentiment analysis.

## Project Overview

The main notebook in this repository contains code to:

- Load and preprocess text data using PySpark's DataFrame API.
- Perform tokenization, stopword removal, and feature extraction using NLP tools.
- Apply machine learning models to classify or analyze text data.

## Getting Started
